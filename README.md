## üéØ Project Context & Business Problem

**AtliQ Hardware** is a rapidly growing computer hardware company with a global presence. Historically, their decisions were based on intuition and basic analysis. To stay competitive and foster a data-driven culture, the management team commissioned a series of ad-hoc data analysis requests.

This project simulates that real-world scenario. The primary objective is to act as a data analyst for AtliQ Hardware, answering ten pressing business questions by writing and executing complex SQL queries against the company's database.

## üí° The Analyst's Process

A successful data analysis project starts long before the first line of SQL is written. It begins with a deep understanding of the stakeholder's needs. Before tackling this project, a good analyst would clarify the following:

* **Project Objective:** What is the primary business goal of this analysis?
* **Success Metrics:** How will the success of these requests be measured?
* **Stakeholder Expectations:** Who will be using these insights and for what purpose?
* **Data Requirements:** What are all the data sources needed to answer these questions?
* **Potential Roadblocks:** What could go wrong, and what are the data quality concerns?

This mindset of asking "why" before "how" is crucial for delivering valuable insights, and it was the guiding principle for this project.
